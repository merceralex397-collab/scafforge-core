# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/pc/projects/spinner
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-04-02T08:20:55Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state only

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 5
- errors: 4
- warnings: 1

## Workflow Findings

### CYCLE001

- finding_id: CYCLE001
- summary: A previous audit-to-repair cycle did not clear one or more workflow-layer findings before work resumed.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: diagnosis/20260402-081954/manifest.json, .opencode/meta/bootstrap-provenance.json
- observed_or_reproduced: The repo contains a prior diagnosis pack and a later repair history entry, but the current audit still reproduces workflow-layer findings. That means the previous repair either skipped a required regeneration step, used stale package logic, or misclassified drift as protected intent.
- evidence:
  - Latest prior diagnosis pack: diagnosis/20260402-081954
  - Repairs recorded after that diagnosis: 1
  - Repeated workflow-layer findings: SKILL001, WFLOW024
  - Repair after diagnosis -> Managed Scafforge repair runner refreshed deterministic workflow surfaces and evaluated downstream repair obligations.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

### WFLOW024

- finding_id: WFLOW024
- summary: Fail-state routing is still under-specified in generated prompts or workflow skills.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/agents/spinner-team-leader.md
- observed_or_reproduced: Even if the tool contract knows how to route a FAIL verdict, weaker models still stall or advance incorrectly when the repo-local workflow explainer and coordinator prompt omit the recovery path.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/agents/spinner-team-leader.md does not tell the coordinator to follow recovery_action when present.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

### SKILL001

- finding_id: SKILL001
- summary: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text instead of project-specific guidance.
- severity: warning
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md
- observed_or_reproduced: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left baseline local skills in a scaffold placeholder state, so agents lose concrete stack and validation guidance.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> When the repo stack is finalized, rewrite this catalog so review and QA agents get the exact build, lint, reference-integrity, and test commands that belong to this project.
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> - When the project stack is confirmed, replace this file's Universal Standards section with stack-specific rules using the `project-skill-bootstrap` skill.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- finding_id: EXEC-GODOT-004
- summary: Godot headless validation fails.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: project.godot
- observed_or_reproduced: The project cannot complete a deterministic headless Godot load pass on the current host, indicating broken project configuration or scripts.
- evidence:
  - ERROR: Failed to open 'user://logs/godot2026-04-02T09.20.55.log'.

### REF-003

- finding_id: REF-003
- summary: Source imports reference missing local modules.
- severity: HIGH
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts
- observed_or_reproduced: At least one local import or require path no longer resolves to a file in the repo, so the runtime graph is internally inconsistent.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts -> ./v4/classic/external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts -> ./v4/classic/external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/index.ts -> ./external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/index.ts -> ./external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/errors.ts -> ./ZodError.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/errors.ts -> ./locales/en.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/ZodError.ts -> ./helpers/typeAliases.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/ZodError.ts -> ./helpers/util.js

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
