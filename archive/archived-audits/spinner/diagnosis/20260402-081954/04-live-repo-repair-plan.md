# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/pc/projects/spinner
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 2
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 5 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

- After deterministic repair, rerun project-local skill regeneration, agent-team follow-up, and prompt hardening before handoff.

### REMED-003

- linked_report_id: WFLOW016
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Parse one-item shell-style overrides into argv, treat leading `KEY=VALUE` tokens as environment overrides, and report malformed overrides as configuration errors instead of misclassifying them as runtime environment failures.

### REMED-004

- linked_report_id: WFLOW023
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Extract verdicts from the latest review and QA artifacts, route FAIL or BLOCKED outcomes back to implementation, and reject lifecycle transitions when the latest artifact verdict is blocking or unclear.

### REMED-005

- linked_report_id: WFLOW024
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Document review, QA, smoke-test, and bootstrap failure recovery paths in ticket-execution, and instruct the team leader to follow transition_guidance.recovery_action whenever it is present.

### REMED-006

- linked_report_id: WFLOW025
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Return verified flags plus current workflow metadata for published restart surfaces and include size or hash metadata for snapshots so callers can confirm what was written.

### REMED-007

- linked_report_id: SKILL001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Populate every baseline local skill with concrete repo-specific rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler.

## Ticket Follow-Up

### REMED-001

- linked_report_id: EXEC-GODOT-004
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket/process repair
- should_scafforge_repair_run: only after managed workflow repair converges
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.
- assignee: implementer
- suggested_fix_approach: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.

### REMED-002

- linked_report_id: REF-003
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket/process repair
- should_scafforge_repair_run: only after managed workflow repair converges
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Audit local relative import paths and fail when the referenced module file is missing.
- assignee: implementer
- suggested_fix_approach: Audit local relative import paths and fail when the referenced module file is missing.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
