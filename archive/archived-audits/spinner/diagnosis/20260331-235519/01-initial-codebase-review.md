# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/rowan/spinner
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-03-31T23:55:19Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state only

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 2
- errors: 1
- warnings: 1

## Validated Findings

### WFLOW010

- finding_id: WFLOW010
- summary: Derived restart surfaces disagree with canonical workflow state, so resume guidance can route work from stale or contradictory facts.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/workflow-state.json, START-HERE.md, .opencode/state/context-snapshot.md, .opencode/state/latest-handoff.md
- observed_or_reproduced: `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` are not being regenerated from `tickets/manifest.json` plus `.opencode/state/workflow-state.json` after workflow mutations or managed repair, leaving bootstrap, repair-follow-on, verification, lane-lease, or active-ticket state stale.
- evidence:
  - START-HERE.md handoff_status drift: expected 'repair follow-up required' from canonical state, found 'workflow verification pending'.
  - .opencode/state/latest-handoff.md handoff_status drift: expected 'repair follow-up required' from canonical state, found 'workflow verification pending'.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

### SKILL001

- finding_id: SKILL001
- summary: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text instead of project-specific guidance.
- severity: warning
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md
- observed_or_reproduced: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left baseline local skills in a scaffold placeholder state, so agents lose concrete stack and validation guidance.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> Replace this file with stack-specific rules once the real project stack is known.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
