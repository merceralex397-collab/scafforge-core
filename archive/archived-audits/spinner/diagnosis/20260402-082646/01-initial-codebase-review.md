# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/pc/projects/spinner
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-04-02T08:26:46Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state only

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 4
- errors: 4
- warnings: 0

## Workflow Findings

### WFLOW010

- finding_id: WFLOW010
- summary: Derived restart surfaces disagree with canonical workflow state, so resume guidance can route work from stale or contradictory facts.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/workflow-state.json, START-HERE.md, .opencode/state/context-snapshot.md, .opencode/state/latest-handoff.md
- observed_or_reproduced: `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` are not being regenerated from `tickets/manifest.json` plus `.opencode/state/workflow-state.json` after workflow mutations or managed repair, leaving bootstrap, repair-follow-on, verification, lane-lease, or active-ticket state stale.
- evidence:
  - START-HERE.md split_child_tickets drift: expected 'REMED-002' from canonical state, found None.
  - .opencode/state/context-snapshot.md open_split_children drift: expected 'REMED-002' from canonical state, found None.
  - .opencode/state/latest-handoff.md split_child_tickets drift: expected 'REMED-002' from canonical state, found None.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

### WFLOW020

- finding_id: WFLOW020
- summary: Open-parent ticket decomposition is missing or routed through non-canonical source modes.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/tools/ticket_create.ts, .opencode/lib/workflow.ts
- observed_or_reproduced: The workflow lacks a first-class split route for child tickets created from an open parent, or it still renders split parents as blocked, so agents encode decomposition through remediation semantics and the parent/child graph drifts.
- evidence:
  - REMED-003 extends open source ticket ANDROID-001 but uses source_mode=net_new_scope instead of split_scope.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- finding_id: EXEC-GODOT-004
- summary: Godot headless validation fails.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: project.godot
- observed_or_reproduced: The project cannot complete a deterministic headless Godot load pass on the current host, indicating broken project configuration or scripts.
- evidence:
  - ERROR: Failed to open 'user://logs/godot2026-04-02T09.26.45.log'.

### REF-003

- finding_id: REF-003
- summary: Source imports reference missing local modules.
- severity: HIGH
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts
- observed_or_reproduced: At least one local import or require path no longer resolves to a file in the repo, so the runtime graph is internally inconsistent.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts -> ./v4/classic/external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts -> ./v4/classic/external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/index.ts -> ./external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/index.ts -> ./external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/errors.ts -> ./ZodError.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/errors.ts -> ./locales/en.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/ZodError.ts -> ./helpers/typeAliases.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/ZodError.ts -> ./helpers/util.js

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
