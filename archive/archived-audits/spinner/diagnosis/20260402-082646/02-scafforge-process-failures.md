# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-GODOT-004
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Godot headless validation fails.

### REF-003

- linked_report_1_finding: REF-003
- implicated_surface: generated repo reference integrity and configuration surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo source and configuration surfaces
- workflow_failure: Source imports reference missing local modules.

### WFLOW010

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW010
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: Derived restart surfaces disagree with canonical workflow state, so resume guidance can route work from stale or contradictory facts.

### WFLOW020

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW020
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: Open-parent ticket decomposition is missing or routed through non-canonical source modes.

## Ownership Classification

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- affected_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces

### REF-003

- ownership_class: generated repo source and configuration surfaces
- affected_surface: generated repo reference integrity and configuration surfaces

### WFLOW010

- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- affected_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces

### WFLOW020

- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- affected_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- root_cause: The project cannot complete a deterministic headless Godot load pass on the current host, indicating broken project configuration or scripts.
- safer_target_pattern: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Godot headless validation fails.

### REF-003

- root_cause: At least one local import or require path no longer resolves to a file in the repo, so the runtime graph is internally inconsistent.
- safer_target_pattern: Audit local relative import paths and fail when the referenced module file is missing.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Source imports reference missing local modules.

### WFLOW010

- root_cause: `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` are not being regenerated from `tickets/manifest.json` plus `.opencode/state/workflow-state.json` after workflow mutations or managed repair, leaving bootstrap, repair-follow-on, verification, lane-lease, or active-ticket state stale.
- safer_target_pattern: Regenerate `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` from canonical manifest/workflow state after every workflow save, compute handoff readiness from bootstrap plus repair-follow-on plus verification state in one shared contract, and fail repair verification if any derived restart surface drifts.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Derived restart surfaces disagree with canonical workflow state, so resume guidance can route work from stale or contradictory facts.

### WFLOW020

- root_cause: The workflow lacks a first-class split route for child tickets created from an open parent, or it still renders split parents as blocked, so agents encode decomposition through remediation semantics and the parent/child graph drifts.
- safer_target_pattern: Support `ticket_create(source_mode=split_scope)` for open-parent decomposition, keep the parent open and non-foreground, and keep open-parent child tickets out of `net_new_scope` and `post_completion_issue` routing.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Open-parent ticket decomposition is missing or routed through non-canonical source modes.
