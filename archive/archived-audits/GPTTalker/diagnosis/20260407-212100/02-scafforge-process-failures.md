# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC001
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: One or more Python packages fail to import — the service cannot start.

### REF-003

- linked_report_1_finding: REF-003
- implicated_surface: generated repo reference integrity and configuration surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo source and configuration surfaces
- workflow_failure: Source imports reference missing local modules.

### WFLOW012

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW012
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: The generated lease-ownership contract is split across coordinator and worker surfaces, so agents can disagree about who should claim a ticket and when bootstrap gates apply.

### SKILL002

- linked_report_1_finding: SKILL002
- implicated_surface: project-skill-bootstrap and agent-prompt-engineering surfaces
- ownership_class: project skill or prompt surface
- workflow_failure: The repo-local `ticket-execution` skill is too thin to explain the actual lifecycle contract to weaker models.

## Ownership Classification

### EXEC001

- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- affected_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces

### REF-003

- ownership_class: generated repo source and configuration surfaces
- affected_surface: generated repo reference integrity and configuration surfaces

### WFLOW012

- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- affected_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces

### SKILL002

- ownership_class: project skill or prompt surface
- affected_surface: project-skill-bootstrap and agent-prompt-engineering surfaces

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC001

- root_cause: Runtime errors (NameError, FastAPIError, missing dependency, broken DI pattern, etc.) that are invisible to static analysis prevent module load. Common causes: TYPE_CHECKING-guarded names used in runtime annotations, FastAPI dependency functions with non-Pydantic parameter types, circular imports.
- safer_target_pattern: Verify every import succeeds: `python -c 'from src.<pkg>.main import app'`. Use string annotations (`-> "TypeName"`) for TYPE_CHECKING-only imports. Use `request: Request` (not `app: FastAPI`) in FastAPI dependency functions.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: One or more Python packages fail to import — the service cannot start.

### REF-003

- root_cause: At least one local import or require path no longer resolves to a file in the repo, so the runtime graph is internally inconsistent.
- safer_target_pattern: Audit local relative import paths and fail when the referenced module file is missing.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Source imports reference missing local modules.

### WFLOW012

- root_cause: Some workflow docs and prompts still describe worker-owned lease claims while others expect the team leader to coordinate claims. That contradiction is enough to make weaker models thrash around ticket ownership and pre-bootstrap write rules.
- safer_target_pattern: Adopt one lease model everywhere: the team leader owns `ticket_claim` and `ticket_release`, specialists work only inside the already-active ticket lease, and only Wave 0 setup work may claim before bootstrap is ready.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The generated lease-ownership contract is split across coordinator and worker surfaces, so agents can disagree about who should claim a ticket and when bootstrap gates apply.

### SKILL002

- root_cause: When the local workflow explainer omits transition guidance, contradiction-stop rules, artifact ownership, or command boundaries, agents fall back to guess-and-check against the tools.
- safer_target_pattern: Keep `ticket-execution` narrowly procedural: route from `ticket_lookup.transition_guidance`, stop after repeated lifecycle contradictions, reserve `smoke_test` as the only PASS producer, and keep slash commands human-only.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The repo-local `ticket-execution` skill is too thin to explain the actual lifecycle contract to weaker models.
