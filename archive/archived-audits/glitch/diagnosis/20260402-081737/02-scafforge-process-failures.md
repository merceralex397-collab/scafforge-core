# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-GODOT-004
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Godot headless validation fails.

### REF-003

- linked_report_1_finding: REF-003
- implicated_surface: generated repo reference integrity and configuration surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo source and configuration surfaces
- workflow_failure: Source imports reference missing local modules.

### WFLOW012

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW012
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: The generated lease-ownership contract is split across coordinator and worker surfaces, so agents can disagree about who should claim a ticket and when bootstrap gates apply.

### WFLOW006

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW006
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: The team leader prompt leaves workflow mechanics underspecified enough that weaker models can thrash or search for bypasses.

## Ownership Classification

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- affected_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces

### REF-003

- ownership_class: generated repo source and configuration surfaces
- affected_surface: generated repo reference integrity and configuration surfaces

### WFLOW006

- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- affected_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces

### WFLOW012

- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- affected_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- root_cause: The project cannot complete a deterministic headless Godot load pass on the current host, indicating broken project configuration or scripts.
- safer_target_pattern: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Godot headless validation fails.

### REF-003

- root_cause: At least one local import or require path no longer resolves to a file in the repo, so the runtime graph is internally inconsistent.
- safer_target_pattern: Audit local relative import paths and fail when the referenced module file is missing.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Source imports reference missing local modules.

### WFLOW012

- root_cause: Some workflow docs and prompts still describe worker-owned lease claims while others expect the team leader to coordinate claims. That contradiction is enough to make weaker models thrash around ticket ownership and pre-bootstrap write rules.
- safer_target_pattern: Adopt one lease model everywhere: the team leader owns `ticket_claim` and `ticket_release`, specialists work only inside the already-active ticket lease, and only Wave 0 setup work may claim before bootstrap is ready.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The generated lease-ownership contract is split across coordinator and worker surfaces, so agents can disagree about who should claim a ticket and when bootstrap gates apply.

### WFLOW006

- root_cause: Without explicit transition guidance, contradiction-stop behavior, artifact-ownership rules, and command boundaries, the coordinator has to infer the state machine and may start authoring artifacts or testing workaround transitions itself.
- safer_target_pattern: Tell the team leader to route from `ticket_lookup.transition_guidance`, stop after repeated lifecycle errors, leave stage artifacts to the owning specialist, and keep slash commands human-only.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The team leader prompt leaves workflow mechanics underspecified enough that weaker models can thrash or search for bypasses.
