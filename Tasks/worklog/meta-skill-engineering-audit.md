# Meta-Skill Engineering Audit Worklog

## Task

Audit, clean, and verify all 19 skills from `LibraryUnverified/03-meta-skill-engineering/` using the meta-skill-engineering skills themselves. Produce verified candidates in `Library/03-meta-skill-engineering/`.

## Summary

- **Input**: 19 unverified skills from external source (Codex skill ecosystem)
- **Output**: 16 verified skills in `Library/03-meta-skill-engineering/`
- **Deleted**: 3 skills (merged or redundant)
- **Total SKILL.md lines**: 2,244 → 1,902 (15% reduction while adding missing content)

---

## Phase 0: Setup

Created `Library/03-meta-skill-engineering/` and `Tasks/worklog/`. Flattened `skill-improver/skill-improver/` double-nesting to `skill-improver/`.

## Phase 1: Triage — Overlap Resolution

### Deleted: `skill-installation`
- **Reason**: 26-line redirect stub containing only "This skill has been merged into skill-installer". Zero unique content.
- **Skills used**: skill-catalog-curation (overlap detection)

### Deleted: `skill-creator` (merged into `skill-authoring`)
- **Reason**: 427 lines, heavily Codex-specific. Depended on `init_skill.py`, `generate_openai_yaml.py`, `quick_validate.py`, `agents/openai.yaml`. ~60% was Codex platform tutorial.
- **What was preserved**: Host-agnostic design guidance merged into `skill-authoring`:
  - "Concise is key" / context window awareness
  - "Match freedom to fragility" framework (high/medium/low freedom)
  - Size targets and progressive disclosure guidance
- **Skills used**: skill-catalog-curation (overlap detection), skill-improver (merge technique)

### Deleted: `skill-refinement` (merged into `skill-improver`)
- **Reason**: 86 lines. Entirely a subset of `skill-improver` Mode 1 (Surgical edit). `skill-improver` already covered all three improvement levels.
- **What was preserved**: Failure-mode categorization table with fix-action mappings merged into `skill-improver` Phase 2. Refinement summary template merged into Mode 1 output.
- **Skills used**: skill-catalog-curation (overlap detection), skill-improver (merge technique)

## Phase 2: De-Codex Pass

Applied to all 16 surviving skills. Changes per skill:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `owner` | `codex` | Removed (moved to frontmatter normalization) |
| `clients` | `[openai-codex, gemini-cli, opencode, github-copilot]` | `[opencode, copilot, codex, gemini-cli, claude-code]` |
| Codex URLs | `developers.openai.com/codex/*` in References | Removed |
| `agents/` dirs | `agents/openai.yaml` | Deleted |
| `overlays/` dirs | 4 client-specific overlay subdirs | Deleted |
| Body text | "Codex" as runtime agent name | Replaced with generic "the agent" |

**Special handling**:
- `skill-installer`: Generalized `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` to multi-client path table, removed `openai/skills` GitHub repo references, changed "Restart Codex" to "Restart the agent client"

## Phase 3: Individual Skill Audit

Each skill processed through a 5-step pipeline. Audit tools processed first (so their techniques were clean when applied to remaining skills).

### Pipeline Applied

| Step | Technique Source | What It Does |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1. Anti-pattern scan | `skill-anti-patterns` | Check for AP-1 through AP-12 structural anti-patterns |
| 2. Trigger optimization | `skill-trigger-optimization` | Rewrite description for routing precision/recall |
| 3. Content refinement | `skill-improver` | Tighten language, remove bloat, strengthen outputs |
| 4. Size check | `skill-reference-extraction` | Extract to references/ if > 150 lines |
| 5. Safety review | `skill-safety-review` | Check scope creep, description-behavior mismatch |

### Per-Skill Audit Results

#### skill-catalog-curation (109 → 107 lines)
- Replaced "Flag >70% overlap" (magic number) with intent-based matching
- Replaced "Apply quality gates" with "Check discoverability" (old step duplicated lifecycle-management)

## Phase 4: Catalog-Level Consistency

### Cross-Reference Fix
Fixed 18 stale references to `skill-refinement` across 10 skills → replaced with `skill-improver`. Verified zero stale refs remain.

### Frontmatter Normalization
Standardized all 16 skills to consistent format:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: >- [text]
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility:
  clients: [opencode, copilot, codex, gemini-cli, claude-code]
---
```
- Removed all `metadata` blocks (owner, domain, maturity, risk, tags — provenance noise, not routing data)
- Removed `allowed-tools` (Codex-specific)
- Added missing `license` and `compatibility` fields to 4 skills

### Final Verification
- Zero stale cross-references
- Zero Codex-specific URLs
- Zero `owner: codex` references
- Consistent frontmatter across all 16 skills
- All skills 87–198 lines (well within bounds)

## Skills Used (and why)

| Skill | How Used | Why This Skill |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **skill-anti-patterns** | Step 1 of pipeline: structural audit of each skill | Detects the structural problems (circular triggers, vague outputs, etc.) that other techniques then fix |
| **skill-trigger-optimization** | Step 2: rewrite descriptions for routing | Description is the highest-leverage field — determines whether skill fires |
| **skill-improver** | Step 3: content refinement, merge technique | Covers surgical edits through structural refactors; used for both individual tightening and the overlap merges |
| **skill-reference-extraction** | Step 4: size check | Determines whether SKILL.md content should be split into references/ |
| **skill-safety-review** | Step 5: safety audit | Catches scope creep, missing safety gates, description-behavior mismatches |
| **skill-catalog-curation** | Phase 1 + Phase 4: overlap detection, consistency | Library-level view: finds duplicates, enforces consistency, checks discoverability |

## Skills NOT Used (and why)

| Skill | Why Not Used |
|-------|-------------|
| **skill-authoring** | Creates new skills from scratch — we were improving existing skills |
| **skill-creator** | Deleted (Codex-specific) — even before deletion, it creates new skills |
| **skill-adaptation** | Adapts skills to different stacks/contexts — we weren't changing target context |
| **skill-benchmarking** | Compares skill variants head-to-head — requires before/after runtime testing, not applicable in static audit |
| **skill-evaluation** | Measures routing/output quality against baseline — requires runtime execution |
| **skill-testing-harness** | Builds test infrastructure — useful but a separate task from content audit |
| **skill-installation** | Deleted (redirect stub) |
| **skill-installer** | Installs skills into agent clients — not relevant to content audit |
| **skill-lifecycle-management** | Manages draft→stable states — useful for maturity tracking but not content improvement |
| **skill-packaging** | Packages for distribution — not relevant to content audit |
| **skill-provenance** | Documents origin/authorship — we already know the origin |
| **skill-variant-splitting** | Splits broad skills into variants — no skills needed splitting (overlaps were resolved by merging instead) |
| **skill-reference-extraction** | Was in the pipeline but no skill exceeded the threshold after refinement — all stayed under 200 lines |

Note: `skill-reference-extraction` was *applied* as a check (Step 4 of every audit) but never *triggered* because all skills came in under the extraction threshold after content refinement.
