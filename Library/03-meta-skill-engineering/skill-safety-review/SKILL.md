  Audit a SKILL.md and its bundled scripts for safety hazards — destructive
  operations missing confirmation gates, excessive permissions, prompt injection
  vectors, scope creep, and description-behavior mismatches. Use when a user
  says "review this skill for safety", "is this skill safe to publish",
  "check for destructive operations", or "audit before sharing". Use before
  publishing to a shared registry, after importing from an untrusted source,
  or when a skill performs consequential operations (file deletion, API calls,
  deployments). Do not use for routing or output-quality evaluation (use
  skill-evaluation), structural anti-pattern detection (use skill-anti-patterns),
  or skills that are purely informational with no side effects.

# Purpose

Audit a skill for safety hazards before it is published, imported, or promoted. Produces a structured verdict with actionable findings.

# When to use

- Before publishing a skill to a shared registry or marketplace
- After importing a skill from an untrusted or external source
- When a skill performs consequential operations (deletion, network calls, deployments)
- When a skill was flagged during a `repo-process-doctor` or catalog audit

Do NOT use when:
- Evaluating routing precision or output quality → `skill-evaluation`
- Detecting structural anti-patterns → `skill-anti-patterns`
- The skill is purely informational with no side effects
- The skill was already reviewed and has not changed

# Procedure

1. **Destructive operations** — scan for file deletion (`rm`, `unlink`), database mutations (`DROP`, `DELETE`), git force operations (`force push`, `reset --hard`), mutating API calls (`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`), and system modifications (`chmod`, `service restart`). Flag any that lack an explicit confirmation gate.

2. **Excessive permissions** — check whether the skill requests more access than its described purpose requires: file writes outside its scope, credential use without justification, or network access not implied by the description. Flag any unjustified permission.

3. **Scope creep** — verify every procedure step is implied by the description. Flag steps that affect systems or files outside the stated scope, or that perform actions the user did not request.

4. **Prompt injection** — identify paths where untrusted external content (file contents, API responses, user-pasted text) flows into instruction context without sanitization. Flag unescaped interpolations and any external-content-to-instruction pipeline.

5. **Description–behavior mismatch** — compare the `description` field and "When to use" section against actual procedure steps. Flag hidden behaviors, understated severity, or actions not disclosed in the description.

6. **Bundled scripts** — if a `scripts/` directory exists, audit for unsafe operations, hardcoded credentials, and undocumented network calls. Flag any operation not documented in SKILL.md.

7. **Partial-failure safety** — check whether destructive operations have rollback or cleanup paths. Flag any destructive step that leaves corrupted state on mid-operation failure.

8. **Verdict** — classify the skill:
   - **Safe** — no findings.
   - **Safe with warnings** — minor issues documented, usable as-is.
   - **Requires changes** — must fix before publishing or promotion.
   - **Unsafe** — fundamental problems; do not use until redesigned.

# Output format

Always produce this structure. Omit table sections that have zero findings.

# Failure handling

- **Skill is too opaque to audit** — verdict is Unsafe; if the reviewer cannot trace behavior, neither can the user.
- **Skill is intentionally destructive** (e.g., cleanup/teardown) — verify the description is explicit about destruction, confirmation gates exist, and scope is bounded. Safe if all three hold.
- **External dependencies are unauditable** — note the trust assumption as a warning; do not mark Safe without disclosure.
