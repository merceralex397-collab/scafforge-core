  Improve an existing skill package — tighten routing, sharpen procedure, add or
  prune support layers, upgrade packaging. Use when the user says "improve this
  skill", "this skill is weak/vague/bloated", "harden this SKILL.md", or "add
  evals/references to this skill package". Do not use for creating a new skill
  from scratch (use skill-authoring), trigger-only fixes when the body is fine
  (use skill-trigger-optimization), porting a skill to a different stack or
  context (use skill-adaptation), or quick structural audits with no rewrite
  (use skill-anti-patterns).

# Purpose

Improve an existing skill package. A skill is a reusable operating manual for an agent. Improving one means improving four things together:

1. **Routing** — whether the right tasks activate it.
2. **Execution** — whether the body gives concrete, repeatable procedure.
3. **Support layers** — whether references, scripts, evals, and manifests exist where they help.
4. **Maintainability** — whether the skill stays narrow and worth activating.

Preserve the skill's core purpose unless the user explicitly asks to reposition it.

# When to use this skill

Use when:

- the user provides a SKILL.md and wants it improved,
- the user says a skill feels weak, vague, generic, bloated, or under-specified,
- the user wants better triggering, structure, examples, or supporting files,
- the user wants to know whether a skill needs references/, scripts/, evals/, or manifest,
- the user wants a thin prompt upgraded into a durable skill package.

Do not use when:

- creating a brand-new skill from scratch — use **skill-authoring**,
- the problem is only the description/trigger and the body is fine — use **skill-trigger-optimization**,
- porting or adapting a skill to a different stack or context — use **skill-adaptation**,
- running a quick structural audit with no rewrite planned — use **skill-anti-patterns**,
- the task is a repo review, architecture review, or product planning exercise.

# Improvement modes

Choose the lightest mode that solves the real problem.

## Mode 1 — Surgical edit

Use when the skill is broadly sound and mainly needs better trigger wording, clearer steps, stronger output contract, or removal of fluff.

Output: updated SKILL.md, concise change summary, optional eval refresh.

Change summary template:

```
**Skill**: [name]
**Failure mode**: [category from Phase 2 table]
**Evidence**: [what went wrong]

### Change
**Section**: [which section changed]
**Before**: [original text]
**After**: [new text]
**Rationale**: [why this fixes the failure mode]

### Verification
- [ ] Existing evals still pass
- [ ] Known good cases still work
- [ ] Failure case now handled
```

## Mode 2 — Structural refactor

Use when the skill has the right goal but poor execution: vague description, no phases, no decision rules, no failure handling, too much in one file.

Output: rewritten SKILL.md, new references/ if justified, eval stubs or updated evals.

## Mode 3 — Package upgrade

Use when the skill should become a first-class reusable package: shared across projects, needs baseline comparisons, needs scripts for repeated mechanics.

Output: improved SKILL.md, manifest, evals, references, scripts only where deterministic, changelog.

# Workflow

Follow these phases in order unless the user clearly wants a lighter pass.

## Phase 1 — Understand the current skill

Identify:

- the skill's current purpose and intended user problem,
- the current activation boundary,
- the main failure mode,
- whether the skill is draft, project-local, or intended for reuse.

Read the existing skill package before editing. If the conversation provides enough context, extract it instead of re-asking.

## Phase 2 — Diagnose the weakness

Name the primary failure mode before rewriting. Map it to a fix target:

| Failure mode | Primary fix target |
|---|---|
| undertriggering | rewrite description with concrete trigger phrases |
| overtriggering | tighten description, add "do not use" boundaries |
| prompt-blob syndrome | replace prose with concrete procedural steps |
| missing branching | add decision rules for common variants |
| wrong output format | fix output contract or output defaults |
| missing edge case | add case to workflow or operating procedure |
| scope creep | add constraints, narrow boundaries |
| bloat | remove unnecessary steps or content |
| resource mismatch | add or remove references/scripts as evidence warrants |
| no proof | add eval stubs or test prompts |
| package rot | add manifest/changelog/ownership metadata |

Score informally against: routing quality, procedural clarity, decision support, support-layer quality, evaluation readiness, maintainability. See `references/skill-quality-rubric.md` for the detailed rubric.

## Phase 3 — Decide what to improve

Improve in this priority order:

1. Clarify purpose.
2. Tighten routing description.
3. Add or improve workflow phases.
4. Add decision rules for common branches.
5. Add output contract and failure handling.
6. Decide whether references, scripts, evals, or manifest are warranted.

For support-layer decisions, see `references/resource-decision-guide.md`.

For skill-type-specific improvement strategies, see `references/skill-type-playbooks.md`.

## Phase 4 — Rewrite with restraint

Prefer concrete decisions over generic advice. Explain *why* where that helps the agent adapt. Do not inflate the skill with policy text that belongs elsewhere.

If the skill spans multiple use cases, add explicit phases, a decision table, or separate mode sections — not one flat list.

## Phase 5 — Add support layers only if justified

Add references when optional depth would clutter SKILL.md or the skill covers multiple variants.

Add scripts when a deterministic task recurs and a script reduces context waste.

Add evals when routing quality matters or the user wants evidence the revision helped.

Add manifest/packaging when the skill is meant to persist or be shared.

Do not add scripts or references merely to make the package feel complete.

## Phase 6 — Self-review

Before presenting the result, verify:

- Description clearly states what the skill does and when it triggers.
- "Do not use" boundaries exist where confusion with adjacent skills is likely.
- Workflow is ordered and branch-aware.
- At least one stop condition, quality gate, or failure path exists.
- Support files are justified rather than ornamental.
- Original purpose is preserved.

If any check fails, revise.

## Phase 7 — Package the result

Return:

- the improved files,
- a short rationale for each major change,
- 2–5 recommended eval prompts for the improved skill,
- risks or open questions, only if something could not be settled cleanly.

# Anti-patterns

Avoid these when improving a skill:

1. **Placeholder upgrades** — replacing one vague paragraph with a longer vague paragraph.
2. **Monolith inflation** — stuffing every idea into SKILL.md instead of using references/.
3. **Tool cosplay** — adding scripts that don't solve a repeated mechanical problem.
4. **Silent repurposing** — changing what the skill is for without telling the user.
5. **Unverifiable improvement** — claiming the skill is better with no eval prompts or review path.

For a full structural anti-pattern catalog, use **skill-anti-patterns**.

# Failure handling

If the skill is too incomplete to improve cleanly:

1. Name what is missing.
2. Preserve what can be salvaged.
3. Produce the lightest viable improved draft.
4. Mark assumptions explicitly.

If the user wants a quick pass rather than a full package upgrade, do that. The point is to improve the skill, not force ceremony.
