  Bundle a completed skill folder into a versioned distributable archive
  with manifest and integrity checksums. Use when a user says "package this
  skill", "bundle for distribution", or "prepare a versioned release".
  Do not use for installing bundles (use skill-installer), writing new
  skills (use skill-authoring), or documenting skill origin and trust
  chain (use skill-provenance).

# Purpose

Bundle a finished skill folder into a distributable archive (tar.gz or zip) containing a manifest, per-file SHA-256 checksums, and optional client-specific overlays so the skill can be versioned, shared, and installed elsewhere.

# When to use

- User asks to package, bundle, or prepare a skill for distribution
- A skill needs a versioned release artifact
- Publishing a skill to a registry or transferring it between repos

# When NOT to use

- Skill is still being written or refined — finish authoring first
- User wants to install a bundle — use **skill-installer**
- User wants to create a skill from scratch — use **skill-authoring**
- User wants to document origin or trust chain — use **skill-provenance**
- Simple folder copy with no versioning or integrity needs

# Procedure

## 1. Validate the skill folder

- Confirm `SKILL.md` exists and has valid YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `license`
- Walk every path referenced in SKILL.md (scripts/, references/) — fail if any file is missing
- Reject skills whose frontmatter `name` is empty or whose `description` is under 20 characters

## 2. Build the manifest

Create `manifest.yaml` at the bundle root:

```yaml
name: <from frontmatter>
version: <semver — prompt user if absent>
description: <from frontmatter>
license: <from frontmatter>
files:          # exhaustive list, no globs
  - SKILL.md
  - scripts/validate.sh
  # … every included file
checksums:      # per-file SHA-256
  SKILL.md: af3b…
  scripts/validate.sh: 9c01…
compatibility:
  clients: <from frontmatter or prompt>
```

- List every file explicitly — no wildcards
- Compute SHA-256 per file, not a single concatenated hash
- If `version` is missing from frontmatter, ask the user; do not default to `1.0.0`

## 3. Generate client overlays (only when needed)

If the skill has client-specific frontmatter or path differences:
- Create `overlays/<client>.yaml` containing only the delta
- Overlays must not contradict the base manifest — they extend it

Skip this step entirely when the skill is client-agnostic.

## 4. Create the archive

- Default format: `tar.gz`. Use `zip` only if the user requests it.
- Name: `<name>-<version>.tar.gz`
- Include: `manifest.yaml`, `SKILL.md`, and every file listed in the manifest
- Exclude: `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.DS_Store`

## 5. Verify the archive

- Extract to a temp directory
- Confirm every file in `manifest.yaml` is present
- Re-hash each file and compare to manifest checksums
- Confirm SKILL.md frontmatter still parses after extraction
- Delete the temp directory

## 6. Report results

Print the verification report (see Output contract).

# Output contract

Every successful run produces exactly:

1. **The archive file** at the path the user specified (or cwd)
2. **A verification report** printed to the user:

```
Archive: skill-name-0.2.0.tar.gz (14 KB)
Files:   5 packaged, 5 verified
Checksums: all matched

Contents:
  manifest.yaml
  SKILL.md
  scripts/validate.sh
  references/schema.md
  overlays/copilot.yaml

Ready to install:
  skill-installer add ./skill-name-0.2.0.tar.gz
```

If verification fails, print the specific mismatches and do **not** declare success.

# Failure handling

| Failure | Action |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` missing or unparseable frontmatter | Stop. Print which required fields are missing or malformed. |
| Referenced file does not exist | Stop. List every missing path so the user can fix all at once. |
| No `version` in frontmatter | Ask the user for a semver version. Do not guess. |
| Checksum mismatch after extraction | Print the file(s) that differ and the expected vs actual hashes. Re-bundle. |
| Overlay contradicts base manifest | Stop. Explain the conflict. Overlays may only add or narrow, not replace base values. |
