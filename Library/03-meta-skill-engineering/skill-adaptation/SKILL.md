description: >-
  Adapt an existing skill to a different repository, stack, team, or project
  context while preserving the core pattern. Use when asked to "port this skill
  to Python/Vue/pnpm", "customize this library skill for our project", or
  "localize this skill for a different environment". Do not use for writing a
  new skill from scratch (use skill-authoring), improving an existing
  project-specific skill without changing context (use skill-improver), or
  splitting one skill into stack-specific variants (use skill-variant-splitting).

# Purpose

Rewrite a skill's context-dependent references — tools, paths, conventions,
terminology — for a different target environment while keeping its core
procedure and safety constraints intact.

# When to use

- Porting a skill between stacks (React → Vue, npm → pnpm, pytest → unittest)
- Installing a library skill that references tools or paths absent in the target project
- Localizing a skill for different team conventions, file structure, or domain terminology

# When NOT to use

- Creating a skill from scratch → `skill-authoring`
- Improving an already project-specific skill without changing context → `skill-improver`
- Splitting a broad skill into focused per-stack variants → `skill-variant-splitting`
- Only the trigger description needs fixing → `skill-trigger-optimization`
- Skill already works correctly in the target context

# Procedure

1. **Read the source skill end-to-end.** Identify the problem it solves, the output it produces, and every assumption it encodes (tools, paths, naming, domain terms).

2. **Define the target context.** Collect: stack/language, file structure conventions, available tools, forbidden tools, domain terminology. If any of these are unclear, ask before proceeding — do not guess.

3. **Catalog adaptation points** — references that MUST change:
   - Tool/command references (`npm` → `pnpm`, `pytest` → `unittest`)
   - File paths and glob patterns (`src/components/` → `app/ui/`)
   - Naming conventions (camelCase → snake_case)
   - Output format references (Markdown → org-mode)
   - Domain terminology ("user" → "customer")

4. **Catalog invariants** — things that must NOT change:
   - Core procedure logic and step ordering
   - Safety constraints and quality checks
   - The fundamental problem being solved

5. **Produce the adapted SKILL.md:**
   - Preserve frontmatter structure
   - Update `description` if the context change affects routing
   - Replace every cataloged adaptation point with its target equivalent
   - Replace or add context-specific examples where the skill uses few-shot patterns
   - Do NOT add provenance/history sections to the adapted skill

6. **Validate — zero dangling references:**
   - Every tool/command reference exists in the target environment
   - Every file path pattern matches the target structure
   - No leftover references to the source context survive

# Output contract

Deliver exactly two artifacts:

1. **Adaptation summary** (inline in response):

```
## Adaptation Summary

**Source skill**: [name]
**Target context**: [stack / project / team]

### Changes
| Original | Adapted | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| npm install | pnpm add | Project uses pnpm |
| src/components/ | app/ui/ | Target file structure |

### Invariants preserved
- [Core procedure element kept intact]
```

2. **Adapted SKILL.md** — the full rewritten file, ready to drop in.

# Failure handling

- **Target context unclear**: Stop and ask — "What stack? What file structure? What tools are available?" Do not assume.
- **No equivalent tool in target**: State the gap explicitly, suggest the closest alternative, and note any behavioral difference.
- **Adaptation would break core logic**: The skill may not be portable. Recommend `skill-authoring` to build a purpose-built replacement instead.
- **Source skill is ambiguous**: State each assumption you made and why. Flag any assumption the user should verify.
